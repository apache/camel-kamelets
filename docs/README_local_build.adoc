= Local/partial build of docs

This should be explained soon at https://camel.apache.org/manual/improving-the-documentation.html.

* (once, or occasionally)
. In `../..` (next to this project's clone) run
[source,sh]
----
git clone https://github.com/apache/camel-website.git
----
. In `../../camel-website/antora-ui-camel` run
[source,sh]
----
yarn build
----
. In this directory run
[source,sh]
----
./local-build.sh full
----
This will build the full Antora site on your machine in the camel-website project under /documentation, with any local changes you have made in this project.
It will also do a full xref check for the entire site.
* Thereafter
. In this directory run
[source,sh]
----
./local-build.sh
----

This will build just this project, with local changes, into the full build from the previous step.
It will start a local webserver for the build site, rebuild when changes are detected, and sync your browser to the changes.

*Provided by: "Apache Software Foundation"*

*Support Level for this Kamelet is: "Preview"*

Send messages to AWS CloudWatch metrics.

There are several properties you can set in the headers, such as:

`metric-name` / `ce-metricname` for the metric name.
`metric-value` / `ce-metricvalue` for the metric value.
`metric-unit` / `ce-metricunit` for the metric unit.
`metric-timestamp` / `ce-metrictimestamp` for the metric timestamp.
`metric-dimension-name` / `ce-metricdimensionname` for the dimension name.
`metric-dimension-value` / `ce-metricdimensionvalue` for the dimension value.

== Usage

This section summarizes how the `aws-cloudwatch-sink` can be used in various contexts.

=== Knative Sink

The `aws-cloudwatch-sink` Kamelet can be used as Knative sink by binding it to a Knative object.

.aws-cloudwatch-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: aws-cloudwatch-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Channel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: aws-cloudwatch-sink
    properties:
      accessKey: "The Access Key"
      cw_namespace: "The Cloud Watch Namespace"
      region: "eu-west-1"
      secretKey: "The Secret Key"
  
----
Make sure you have xref:latest@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] into the Kubernetes cluster you're connected to.

Save the `aws-cloudwatch-sink-binding.yaml` file into your hard drive, then configure it according to your needs.

You can run the sink using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f aws-cloudwatch-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Dependencies*

The Kamelet needs the following dependencies:

- camel:aws2-cw
- camel:kamelet 

==== *Binding to Knative using the Kamel CLI:*

The procedure described above can be simplified into a single execution of the `kamel bind` command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind channel:mychannel aws-cloudwatch-sink -p "sink.accessKey=The Access Key" -p "sink.cw_namespace=The Cloud Watch Namespace" -p "sink.region=eu-west-1" -p "sink.secretKey=The Secret Key"
----

This will create the KameletBinding under the hood and apply it to the current namespace in the cluster.

=== Kafka Sink

The `aws-cloudwatch-sink` Kamelet can be used as Kafka sink by binding it to a Kafka topic.

.aws-cloudwatch-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: aws-cloudwatch-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: KafkaTopic
      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: aws-cloudwatch-sink
    properties:
      accessKey: "The Access Key"
      cw_namespace: "The Cloud Watch Namespace"
      region: "eu-west-1"
      secretKey: "The Secret Key"
  
----

Ensure that you've installed https://strimzi.io/[Strimzi] and created a topic named `my-topic` in the current namespace.
Make also sure you have xref:latest@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] into the Kubernetes cluster you're connected to.

Save the `aws-cloudwatch-sink-binding.yaml` file into your hard drive, then configure it according to your needs.

You can run the sink using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f aws-cloudwatch-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Binding to Kafka using the Kamel CLI:*

The procedure described above can be simplified into a single execution of the `kamel bind` command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1:KafkaTopic:my-topic aws-cloudwatch-sink -p "sink.accessKey=The Access Key" -p "sink.cw_namespace=The Cloud Watch Namespace" -p "sink.region=eu-west-1" -p "sink.secretKey=The Secret Key"
----

This will create the KameletBinding under the hood and apply it to the current namespace in the cluster.

== Usage

This section describes how you can use the `message-timestamp-router-action`.

=== Knative Action

You can use the `message-timestamp-router-action` Kamelet as an intermediate step in a Knative binding.

.message-timestamp-router-action-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: message-timestamp-router-action-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: timer-source
    properties:
      message: "Hello"
  steps:
  - ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: message-timestamp-router-action
    properties:
      timestampKeys: "The Timestamp Keys"
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Channel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel

----

==== *Prerequisite*

You have xref:{camel-k-version}@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] on the cluster.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `message-timestamp-router-action-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the action by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f message-timestamp-router-action-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the action by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind timer-source?message=Hello --step message-timestamp-router-action -p "step-0.timestampKeys=The Timestamp Keys" channel:mychannel
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.

=== Kafka Action

You can use the `message-timestamp-router-action` Kamelet as an intermediate step in a Kafka binding.

.message-timestamp-router-action-binding.yaml

*Provided by: "Apache Software Foundation"*

*Support Level for this Kamelet is: "Preview"*

Send data to Kafka topics on an insecure broker.

The Kamelet is able to understand the following headers to be set:

- `partition-key` / `ce-partition-key`: as message partition key

Both the headers are optional.

== Configuration Options

The following table summarizes the configuration options available for the `kafka-not-secured-sink` Kamelet:
[width="100%",cols="2,^2,3,^2,^2,^3",options="header"]
|===
| Property| Name| Description| Type| Default| Example
| *brokers {empty}* *| Brokers| Comma separated list of Kafka Broker URLs| string| | 
| *topic {empty}* *| Topic Names| Comma separated list of Kafka topic names| string| | 
|===

NOTE: Fields marked with ({empty}*) are mandatory.

== Usage

This section summarizes how the `kafka-not-secured-sink` can be used in various contexts.

=== Knative Sink

The `kafka-not-secured-sink` Kamelet can be used as Knative sink by binding it to a Knative object.

.kafka-not-secured-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: kafka-not-secured-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: InMemoryChannel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: kafka-not-secured-sink
    properties:
      brokers: "The Brokers"
      topic: "The Topic Names"
  
----
Make sure you have xref:latest@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] into the Kubernetes cluster you're connected to.

Save the `kafka-not-secured-sink-binding.yaml` file into your hard drive, then configure it according to your needs.

You can run the sink using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f kafka-not-secured-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Dependencies*

The Kamelet needs the following dependencies:


- camel:kafka

- camel:kamelet
 

==== *Binding to Knative using the Kamel CLI:*

The procedure described above can be simplified into a single execution of the `kamel bind` command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind channel/mychannel kafka-not-secured-sink -p "sink.brokers=The Brokers" -p "sink.topic=The Topic Names"
----

This will create the KameletBinding under the hood and apply it to the current namespace in the cluster.

=== Kafka Sink

The `kafka-not-secured-sink` Kamelet can be used as Kafka sink by binding it to a Kafka topic.

.kafka-not-secured-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: kafka-not-secured-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: KafkaTopic
      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: kafka-not-secured-sink
    properties:
      brokers: "The Brokers"
      topic: "The Topic Names"
  
----

Ensure that you've installed https://strimzi.io/[Strimzi] and created a topic named `my-topic` in the current namespace.
Make also sure you have xref:latest@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] into the Kubernetes cluster you're connected to.

Save the `kafka-not-secured-sink-binding.yaml` file into your hard drive, then configure it according to your needs.

You can run the sink using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f kafka-not-secured-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Binding to Kafka using the Kamel CLI:*

The procedure described above can be simplified into a single execution of the `kamel bind` command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1:KafkaTopic:my-topic kafka-not-secured-sink -p "sink.brokers=The Brokers" -p "sink.topic=The Topic Names"
----

This will create the KameletBinding under the hood and apply it to the current namespace in the cluster.

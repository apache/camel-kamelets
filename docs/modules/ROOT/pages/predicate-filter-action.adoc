*Provided by: "Apache Software Foundation"*

*Support Level for this Kamelet is: "Preview"*

Filter based on a JsonPath Expression

== Configuration Options

The following table summarizes the configuration options available for the `predicate-filter-action` Kamelet:
[width="100%",cols="2,^2,3,^2,^2,^3",options="header"]
|===
| Property| Name| Description| Type| Default| Example
| *expression {empty}* *| Expression| The JsonPath Expression to evaluate, without the external parenthesis. Since this is a filter, the expression will be a negation, this means that if the foo field of the example is equals to John, the message will go ahead, otherwise it will be filtered out.| string| | `"@.foo =~ /.*John/"`
|===

NOTE: Fields marked with an asterisk ({empty}*) are mandatory.


== Dependencies

At runtime, the `predicate-filter-action Kamelet relies upon the presence of the following dependencies:

- camel:kamelet
- camel:jsonpath 

== Usage

This section describes how you can use the `predicate-filter-action`.

=== Knative Action

You can use the `predicate-filter-action` Kamelet as an intermediate step in a Knative binding.

.predicate-filter-action-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: predicate-filter-action-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: timer-source
    properties:
      message: "Hello"
  steps:
  - ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: predicate-filter-action
    properties:
      expression: "@.foo =~ /.*John/"
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Channel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel

==== *Prerequisite*

You have xref:next@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] on the cluster.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `predicate-filter-action-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the action by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f predicate-filter-action-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the action by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind timer-source?message=Hello --step predicate-filter-action -p "step-0.expression=@.foo =~ /.*John/" channel:mychannel
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.

=== Kafka Action

You can use the `predicate-filter-action` Kamelet as an intermediate step in a Kafka binding.

.predicate-filter-action-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: predicate-filter-action-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1

  sink:
    ref:
      kind: KafkaTopic
      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic

----

==== *Prerequisites*

* You've installed https://strimzi.io/[Strimzi].
* You've created a topic named `my-topic` in the current namespace.
* You have xref:next@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] on the cluster.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `predicate-filter-action-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the action by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f predicate-filter-action-binding.yaml

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind timer-source?message=Hello --step predicate-filter-action -p "step-0.expression=@.foo =~ /.*John/" kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1:KafkaTopic:my-topic
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.

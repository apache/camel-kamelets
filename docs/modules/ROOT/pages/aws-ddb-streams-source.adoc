*Provided by: "Apache Software Foundation"*

*Support Level for this Kamelet is: "Preview"*

Receive events from AWS DynamoDB Streams.

== Configuration Options

The following table summarizes the configuration options available for the `aws-ddb-streams-source` Kamelet:
[width="100%",cols="2,^2,3,^2,^2,^3",options="header"]
|===
| Property| Name| Description| Type| Default| Example
| *accessKey {empty}* *| Access Key| The access key obtained from AWS| string| | 
| *region {empty}* *| AWS Region| The AWS region to connect to| string| | `"eu-west-1"`
| *secretKey {empty}* *| Secret Key| The secret key obtained from AWS| string| | 
| *table {empty}* *| Table| Name of the DynamoDB table to look at| string| | 
| iteratorType| Iterator Type| Defines where in the DynaboDB stream to start getting records. Note that using TRIM_HORIZON can cause a significant delay before the stream has caught up to real-time. if {AT,AFTER}_SEQUENCE_NUMBER are used, then a sequenceNumberProvider MUST be supplied. There are 4 enums and the value can be one of TRIM_HORIZON, LATEST, AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER, AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER| string| `"LATEST"`| 
| sequenceNumberProvider| Sequence Number Provider| Provider for the sequence number when using one of the two ShardIteratorType AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER or AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER iterator types. Can be a registry reference or a literal sequence number.| string| `"000000000000000000000"`| `"900000000005745712447"`

== Dependencies

At runtime, the `aws-ddb-streams-source Kamelet relies upon the presence of the following dependencies:

- camel:gson
- camel:aws2-ddb
- camel:kamelet 

== Usage

This section describes how you can use the `aws-ddb-streams-source`.

=== Knative Source

You can use the `aws-ddb-streams-source` Kamelet as a Knative source by binding it to a Knative object.

.aws-ddb-streams-source-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: aws-ddb-streams-source-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: aws-ddb-streams-source
    properties:
      accessKey: "The Access Key"
      region: "eu-west-1"
      secretKey: "The Secret Key"
      table: "The Table"
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Channel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
  
----

==== *Prerequisite*

You have xref:next@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] on the cluster.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `aws-ddb-streams-source-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the source by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f aws-ddb-streams-source-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the source by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind aws-ddb-streams-source -p "source.accessKey=The Access Key" -p "source.region=eu-west-1" -p "source.secretKey=The Secret Key" -p "source.table=The Table" channel:mychannel
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.

=== Kafka Source

You can use the `aws-ddb-streams-source` Kamelet as a Kafka source by binding it to a Kafka topic.

.aws-ddb-streams-source-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: aws-ddb-streams-source-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: aws-ddb-streams-source
    properties:
      accessKey: "The Access Key"
      region: "eu-west-1"
      secretKey: "The Secret Key"
      table: "The Table"
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: KafkaTopic
      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic
  
----

==== *Prerequisites*

* You've installed https://strimzi.io/[Strimzi].
* You've created a topic named `my-topic` in the current namespace.
* You have xref:next@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] on the cluster.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `aws-ddb-streams-source-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the source by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f aws-ddb-streams-source-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the source by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind aws-ddb-streams-source -p "source.accessKey=The Access Key" -p "source.region=eu-west-1" -p "source.secretKey=The Secret Key" -p "source.table=The Table" kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1:KafkaTopic:my-topic
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.

[width="100%",cols="2,^2,3,^2,^2,^3",options="header"]
|===
| Property| Name| Description| Type| Default| Example
| *masterUrl {empty}* *| Kubernetes Master URL| The Kubernetes Cluster Master URL| string| | 
| *token {empty}* *| Oauth Token| The Auth Token to connect to Kubernetes Cluster| string| |

NOTE: Fields marked with ({empty}*) are mandatory.

== Usage

This section summarizes how the `kubernetes-pods-source` can be used in various contexts.

=== Knative Source

The `kubernetes-pods-source` Kamelet can be used as Knative source by binding it to a Knative object.

.kubernetes-pods-source-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: kubernetes-pods-source-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: kubernetes-pods-source
    properties:
      masterUrl: "The Kubernetes Master URL"
      token: "The Oauth Token"
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: InMemoryChannel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
  
----
Make sure you have xref:latest@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] into the Kubernetes cluster you're connected to.

Save the `kubernetes-pods-source-binding.yaml` file into your hard drive, then configure it according to your needs.

You can run the source using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f kubernetes-pods-source-binding.yaml
----

==== *Dependencies*

The Kamelet needs the following dependencies:


- camel:kubernetes
- camel:kamelet
- camel:jackson 

==== *Binding to Knative using the Kamel CLI:*

The procedure described above can be simplified into a single execution of the `kamel bind` command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind kubernetes-pods-source -p "source.masterUrl=The Kubernetes Master URL" -p "source.token=The Oauth Token" channel/mychannel
----

This will create the KameletBinding under the hood and apply it to the current namespace in the cluster.

=== Kafka Source

The `kubernetes-pods-source` Kamelet can be used as Kafka source by binding it to a Kafka topic.

.kubernetes-pods-source-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: kubernetes-pods-source-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: kubernetes-pods-source
    properties:
      masterUrl: "The Kubernetes Master URL"
      token: "The Oauth Token"
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: KafkaTopic
      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic
  
----

Ensure that you've installed https://strimzi.io/[Strimzi] and created a topic named `my-topic` in the current namespace.
Make also sure you have xref:latest@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] into the Kubernetes cluster you're connected to.

Save the `kubernetes-pods-source-binding.yaml` file into your hard drive, then configure it according to your needs.

You can run the source using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f kubernetes-pods-source-binding.yaml
----

==== *Binding to Kafka using the Kamel CLI:*

The procedure described above can be simplified into a single execution of the `kamel bind` command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind kubernetes-pods-source -p "source.masterUrl=The Kubernetes Master URL" -p "source.token=The Oauth Token" kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1:KafkaTopic:my-topic
----

This will create the KameletBinding under the hood and apply it to the current namespace in the cluster.

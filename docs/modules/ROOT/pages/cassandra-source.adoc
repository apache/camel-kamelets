== Dependencies

At runtime, the `cassandra-source Kamelet relies upon the presence of the following dependencies:

- camel:jackson
- camel:kamelet
- camel:cassandraql 

== Usage

This section describes how you can use the `cassandra-source`.

=== Knative Source

You can use the `cassandra-source` Kamelet as a Knative source by binding it to a Knative object.

.cassandra-source-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: cassandra-source-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: cassandra-source
    properties:
      connectionHost: "localhost"
      connectionPort: 9042
      keyspace: "customers"
      password: "The Password"
      query: "The Query"
      username: "The Username"
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Channel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
  
----

==== *Prerequisite*

You have xref:{camel-k-version}@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] on the cluster.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `cassandra-source-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the source by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f cassandra-source-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the source by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind cassandra-source -p "source.connectionHost=localhost" -p source.connectionPort=9042 -p "source.keyspace=customers" -p "source.password=The Password" -p "source.query=The Query" -p "source.username=The Username" channel:mychannel
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.

=== Kafka Source

You can use the `cassandra-source` Kamelet as a Kafka source by binding it to a Kafka topic.

.cassandra-source-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: cassandra-source-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: cassandra-source
    properties:
      connectionHost: "localhost"
      connectionPort: 9042
      keyspace: "customers"
      password: "The Password"
      query: "The Query"
      username: "The Username"
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: KafkaTopic
      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic
  
----

==== *Prerequisites*

* You've installed https://strimzi.io/[Strimzi].
* You've created a topic named `my-topic` in the current namespace.
* You have xref:{camel-k-version}@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] on the cluster.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `cassandra-source-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the source by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f cassandra-source-binding.yaml

== Usage

This section describes how you can use the `aws-kinesis-firehose-sink`.

=== Knative Sink

You can use the `aws-kinesis-firehose-sink` Kamelet as a Knative sink by binding it to a Knative object.

.aws-kinesis-firehose-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: aws-kinesis-firehose-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Channel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: aws-kinesis-firehose-sink
    properties:
      accessKey: "The Access Key"
      region: "eu-west-1"
      secretKey: "The Secret Key"
      streamName: "The Stream Name"
  
----

==== *Prerequisite*

You have xref:{camel-k-version}@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] on the cluster.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `aws-kinesis-firehose-sink-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the sink by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f aws-kinesis-firehose-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the sink by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind channel:mychannel aws-kinesis-firehose-sink -p "sink.accessKey=The Access Key" -p "sink.region=eu-west-1" -p "sink.secretKey=The Secret Key" -p "sink.streamName=The Stream Name"
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.

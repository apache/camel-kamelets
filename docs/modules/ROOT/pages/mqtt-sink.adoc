== Usage

This section describes how you can use the `mqtt-sink`.

=== Knative Sink

You can use the `mqtt-sink` Kamelet as a Knative sink by binding it to a Knative object.

.mqtt-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: mqtt-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Channel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: mqtt-sink
    properties:
      brokerUrl: "tcp://mosquitto:1883"
      topic: "mytopic"
  
----

==== *Prerequisite*

You have xref:latest@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] on the cluster.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `mqtt-sink-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the sink by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f mqtt-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the sink by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind channel:mychannel mqtt-sink -p "sink.brokerUrl=tcp://mosquitto:1883" -p "sink.topic=mytopic"
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.

=== Kafka Sink

You can use the `mqtt-sink` Kamelet as a Kafka sink by binding it to a Kafka topic.

.mqtt-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: mqtt-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: KafkaTopic
      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: mqtt-sink
    properties:
      brokerUrl: "tcp://mosquitto:1883"
      topic: "mytopic"
  
----

==== *Prerequisites*

* You've installed https://strimzi.io/[Strimzi].
* You've created a topic named `my-topic` in the current namespace.
* You have xref:latest@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] on the cluster.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `mqtt-sink-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the sink by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f mqtt-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the sink by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1:KafkaTopic:my-topic mqtt-sink -p "sink.brokerUrl=tcp://mosquitto:1883" -p "sink.topic=mytopic"
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.

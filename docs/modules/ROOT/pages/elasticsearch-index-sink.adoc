*Provided by: "Apache Software Foundation"*

This sink stores documents into ElasticSearch.

Input data must have JSON format according to the index used.

If the *indexId* parameter is set, that value will be used as the document ID on ElasticSearch.

If the *indexId* parameter is not set and the source of the kamelet binding is a Kafka broker, it will take the kafka topic, partition and offset of the
element to generate an automatic ID that warrantees that this element is processed only once.

If the *indexName* parameter is not set and the source of the kamelet binding is a Kafka broker, it will take the kafka topic as the indexName.

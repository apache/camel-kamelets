*Provided by: "Apache Software Foundation"*

*Support Level for this Kamelet is: "Preview"*

This sink stores documents into ElasticSearch.

Input data must have JSON format according to the index used.

- `indexId` / `ce-indexId`: as the index ID for Elasticsearch

If the header won't be set the exchange ID will be used as index.

- `indexName` / `ce-indexName`: as the index Name for Elasticsearch

If the header won't be set the exchange ID will be used as index name.

== Usage

This section summarizes how the `elasticsearch-index-sink` can be used in various contexts.

=== Knative Sink

The `elasticsearch-index-sink` Kamelet can be used as Knative sink by binding it to a Knative object.

.elasticsearch-index-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: elasticsearch-index-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: InMemoryChannel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: elasticsearch-index-sink
    properties:
      clusterName: "quickstart"
      hostAddresses: "quickstart-es-http:9200"
  
----
Make sure you have xref:latest@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] into the Kubernetes cluster you're connected to.

Save the `elasticsearch-index-sink-binding.yaml` file into your hard drive, then configure it according to your needs.

You can run the sink using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f elasticsearch-index-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Dependencies*

The Kamelet needs the following dependencies:

- camel:jackson
- camel:kamelet
- mvn:org.apache.camel.k:camel-k-kamelet-reify
- camel:elasticsearch-rest
- camel:gson
- camel:bean 

==== *Binding to Knative using the Kamel CLI:*

The procedure described above can be simplified into a single execution of the `kamel bind` command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind channel:mychannel elasticsearch-index-sink -p "sink.clusterName=quickstart" -p "sink.hostAddresses=quickstart-es-http:9200"
----

This will create the KameletBinding under the hood and apply it to the current namespace in the cluster.

=== Kafka Sink

The `elasticsearch-index-sink` Kamelet can be used as Kafka sink by binding it to a Kafka topic.

.elasticsearch-index-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: elasticsearch-index-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: KafkaTopic
      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: elasticsearch-index-sink
    properties:
      clusterName: "quickstart"
      hostAddresses: "quickstart-es-http:9200"
  
----

Ensure that you've installed https://strimzi.io/[Strimzi] and created a topic named `my-topic` in the current namespace.
Make also sure you have xref:latest@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] into the Kubernetes cluster you're connected to.

Save the `elasticsearch-index-sink-binding.yaml` file into your hard drive, then configure it according to your needs.

You can run the sink using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f elasticsearch-index-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Binding to Kafka using the Kamel CLI:*

The procedure described above can be simplified into a single execution of the `kamel bind` command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1:KafkaTopic:my-topic elasticsearch-index-sink -p "sink.clusterName=quickstart" -p "sink.hostAddresses=quickstart-es-http:9200"
----

This will create the KameletBinding under the hood and apply it to the current namespace in the cluster.

=== Knative Sink

You can use the `mail-sink` Kamelet as a Knative sink by binding it to a Knative object.

.mail-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: mail-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Channel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: mail-sink
    properties:
      connectionHost: "smtp.gmail.com"
      password: "The Password"

= image:kamelets/webhook-source.svg[] Webhook Source

*Provided by: "Apache Software Foundation"*

*Support Level for this Kamelet is: "Preview"*

Creates an HTTP endpoint that can be used as a bridge to forward data to the Kamelet sink.

The "subpath" parameter of the Webhook source allows to customize the subpath where the integration will respond to HTTP requests.
It's common to use a non-guessable ID for that parameter.

When the "subpath" parameter is set to "webhook" (default), the integration will accept requests at the "https://integration-external-url/webhook" endpoint.

== Usage

This section describes how you can use the `webhook-source`.

=== Knative Source

You can use the `webhook-source` Kamelet as a Knative source by binding it to a Knative object.

.webhook-source-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: webhook-source-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: webhook-source
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Channel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
  
----

==== *Prerequisite*

You have xref:{camel-k-version}@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] on the cluster.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `webhook-source-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the source by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]

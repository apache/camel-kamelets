= image:kamelets/webhook-source.svg[] Webhook Source

*Provided by: "Apache Software Foundation"*

Creates an HTTP endpoint that can be used as a bridge to forward data to the Kamelet sink.

The "subpath" parameter of the Webhook source allows to customize the subpath where the integration will respond to HTTP requests.
It's common to use a non-guessable ID for that parameter.

When the "subpath" parameter is set to "webhook" (default), the integration will accept requests at the "https://integration-external-url/webhook" endpoint.

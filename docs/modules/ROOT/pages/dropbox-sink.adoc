*Provided by: "Apache Software Foundation"*

*Support Level for this Kamelet is: "Preview"*

Upload Files to Dropbox.

The Kamelet expects the following headers to be set:

- `file` / `ce-file`: as the file name to upload

If the header won't be set the exchange ID will be used as file name.

== Configuration Options

The following table summarizes the configuration options available for the `dropbox-sink` Kamelet:
[width="100%",cols="2,^2,3,^2,^2,^3",options="header"]
|===
| Property| Name| Description| Type| Default| Example
| *accessToken {empty}* *| Dropbox Access Token| The access Token to use to access Dropbox| string| | 
| *clientIdentifier {empty}* *| Client Identifier| Dropbox App client Identifier| string| | 
| *remotePath {empty}* *| Remote Path| Original file or folder to work with| string| | 
| *uploadMode {empty}* *| Upload Mode| Which mode to upload. in case of add the new file will be renamed if a file with the same name already exists on dropbox. in case of force if a file with the same name already exists on dropbox, this will be overwritten. The value can be one of add, force.| string| `"add"`| 
|===

NOTE: Fields marked with ({empty}*) are mandatory.

== Usage

This section summarizes how the `dropbox-sink` can be used in various contexts.

=== Knative Sink

The `dropbox-sink` Kamelet can be used as Knative sink by binding it to a Knative object.

.dropbox-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: dropbox-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Channel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: dropbox-sink
    properties:
      accessToken: "The Dropbox Access Token"
      clientIdentifier: "The Client Identifier"
      remotePath: "The Remote Path"
  
----
Make sure you have xref:latest@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] into the Kubernetes cluster you're connected to.

Save the `dropbox-sink-binding.yaml` file into your hard drive, then configure it according to your needs.

You can run the sink using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f dropbox-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Dependencies*

The Kamelet needs the following dependencies:

- camel:dropbox
- camel:kamelet 

==== *Binding to Knative using the Kamel CLI:*

The procedure described above can be simplified into a single execution of the `kamel bind` command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind channel:mychannel dropbox-sink -p "sink.accessToken=The Dropbox Access Token" -p "sink.clientIdentifier=The Client Identifier" -p "sink.remotePath=The Remote Path"
----

This will create the KameletBinding under the hood and apply it to the current namespace in the cluster.

=== Kafka Sink

The `dropbox-sink` Kamelet can be used as Kafka sink by binding it to a Kafka topic.

.dropbox-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: dropbox-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: KafkaTopic
      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: dropbox-sink
    properties:
      accessToken: "The Dropbox Access Token"
      clientIdentifier: "The Client Identifier"
      remotePath: "The Remote Path"
  
----

Ensure that you've installed https://strimzi.io/[Strimzi] and created a topic named `my-topic` in the current namespace.
Make also sure you have xref:latest@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] into the Kubernetes cluster you're connected to.

Save the `dropbox-sink-binding.yaml` file into your hard drive, then configure it according to your needs.

You can run the sink using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f dropbox-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Binding to Kafka using the Kamel CLI:*

The procedure described above can be simplified into a single execution of the `kamel bind` command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1:KafkaTopic:my-topic dropbox-sink -p "sink.accessToken=The Dropbox Access Token" -p "sink.clientIdentifier=The Client Identifier" -p "sink.remotePath=The Remote Path"
----

This will create the KameletBinding under the hood and apply it to the current namespace in the cluster.

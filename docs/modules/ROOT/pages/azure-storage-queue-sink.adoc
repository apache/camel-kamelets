*Provided by: "Apache Software Foundation"*

*Support Level for this Kamelet is: "Preview"*

Send Messages to Azure Storage queues.

The Kamelet is able to understand the following headers to be set:

- `expiration` / `ce-expiration`: as the time to live of the message in the queue.

If the header won't be set the default of 7 days will be used.

The format should be in this form: PnDTnHnMn.nS., e.g: PT20.345S — parses as 20.345 seconds, P2D — parses as 2 days.

== Configuration Options

[width="100%",cols="2,^2,3,^2,^2,^3",options="header"]
|===
| Property| Name| Description| Type| Default| Example
| *accessKey {empty}* *| Access Key| The Azure Storage Queue access Key.| string| | 
| *accountName {empty}* *| Account Name| The Azure Storage Queue account name.| string| | 
| *queueName {empty}* *| Queue Name| The Azure Storage Queue container name.| string| |

== Usage

This section summarizes how the `azure-storage-queue-sink` can be used in various contexts.

=== Knative Sink

The `azure-storage-queue-sink` Kamelet can be used as Knative sink by binding it to a Knative object.

.azure-storage-queue-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: azure-storage-queue-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Channel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: azure-storage-queue-sink
    properties:
      accessKey: "The Access Key"
      accountName: "The Account Name"
      queueName: "The Queue Name"
  
----
Make sure you have xref:latest@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] into the Kubernetes cluster you're connected to.

Save the `azure-storage-queue-sink-binding.yaml` file into your hard drive, then configure it according to your needs.

You can run the sink using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f azure-storage-queue-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Dependencies*

The Kamelet needs the following dependencies:

- camel:azure-storage-queue
- camel:kamelet 

==== *Binding to Knative using the Kamel CLI:*

The procedure described above can be simplified into a single execution of the `kamel bind` command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind channel:mychannel azure-storage-queue-sink -p "sink.accessKey=The Access Key" -p "sink.accountName=The Account Name" -p "sink.queueName=The Queue Name"
----

This will create the KameletBinding under the hood and apply it to the current namespace in the cluster.

=== Kafka Sink

The `azure-storage-queue-sink` Kamelet can be used as Kafka sink by binding it to a Kafka topic.

.azure-storage-queue-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: azure-storage-queue-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: KafkaTopic
      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: azure-storage-queue-sink
    properties:
      accessKey: "The Access Key"
      accountName: "The Account Name"
      queueName: "The Queue Name"
  
----

Ensure that you've installed https://strimzi.io/[Strimzi] and created a topic named `my-topic` in the current namespace.
Make also sure you have xref:latest@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] into the Kubernetes cluster you're connected to.

Save the `azure-storage-queue-sink-binding.yaml` file into your hard drive, then configure it according to your needs.

You can run the sink using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f azure-storage-queue-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Binding to Kafka using the Kamel CLI:*

The procedure described above can be simplified into a single execution of the `kamel bind` command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1:KafkaTopic:my-topic azure-storage-queue-sink -p "sink.accessKey=The Access Key" -p "sink.accountName=The Account Name" -p "sink.queueName=The Queue Name"
----

This will create the KameletBinding under the hood and apply it to the current namespace in the cluster.

*Provided by: "Apache Software Foundation"*

*Support Level for this Kamelet is: "Preview"*

Send Messages to Azure Storage queues.

The Kamelet is able to understand the following headers to be set:

- `expiration` / `ce-expiration`: as the time to live of the message in the queue.

If the header won't be set the default of 7 days will be used.

The format should be in this form: PnDTnHnMn.nS., e.g: PT20.345S — parses as 20.345 seconds, P2D — parses as 2 days.

=== Knative Sink

You can use the `azure-storage-queue-sink` Kamelet as a Knative sink by binding it to a Knative object.

.azure-storage-queue-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: azure-storage-queue-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Channel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: azure-storage-queue-sink
    properties:
      accessKey: "The Access Key"
      accountName: "The Account Name"
      queueName: "The Queue Name"
  
----

==== *Prerequisite*

You have xref:next@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] on the cluster.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `azure-storage-queue-sink-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the sink by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f azure-storage-queue-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the sink by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind channel:mychannel azure-storage-queue-sink -p "sink.accessKey=The Access Key" -p "sink.accountName=The Account Name" -p "sink.queueName=The Queue Name"
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.

*Provided by: "Apache Software Foundation"*

*Support Level for this Kamelet is: "Preview"*

Perform operations on a caffeine cache

The Kamelet expects the following headers to be set:

- `caffeine-key` / `ce-caffeine-key`: as the cache key used in the operation

- `caffeine-operation` / `ce-caffeine-operation`: as the operation to perform. It can be PUT, GET, INVALIDATE and CLEANUP.

If the caffeine-key header won't be set the exchange ID will be used as key.

If the caffeine-operation header won't be set, the GET operation will be performed.

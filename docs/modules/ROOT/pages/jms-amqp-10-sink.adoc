== Usage

This section summarizes how the `jms-amqp-10-sink` can be used in various contexts.

=== Knative Sink

The `jms-amqp-10-sink` Kamelet can be used as Knative sink by binding it to a Knative object.

.jms-amqp-10-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: jms-amqp-10-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: InMemoryChannel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: jms-amqp-10-sink
    properties:
      brokerURL: "amqp://k3s-node-master.usersys.redhat.com:31616"
      destinationName: "The Destination Name"

----

Make sure you have xref:latest@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] into the Kubernetes cluster you're connected to.

Save the `jms-amqp-10-sink-binding.yaml` file into your hard drive, then configure it according to your needs.

You can run the sink using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f jms-amqp-10-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Binding to Knative using the Kamel CLI:*

The procedure described above can be simplified into a single execution of the `kamel bind` command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind channel/mychannel jms-amqp-10-sink -p "sink.brokerURL=amqp://k3s-node-master.usersys.redhat.com:31616" -p "sink.destinationName=The Destination Name"
----

This will create the KameletBinding under the hood and apply it to the current namespace in the cluster.

=== Kafka Sink

The `jms-amqp-10-sink` Kamelet can be used as Kafka sink by binding it to a Kafka topic.

.jms-amqp-10-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: jms-amqp-10-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: KafkaTopic
      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: jms-amqp-10-sink
    properties:
      brokerURL: "amqp://k3s-node-master.usersys.redhat.com:31616"
      destinationName: "The Destination Name"

----

Ensure that you've installed https://strimzi.io/[Strimzi] and created a topic named `my-topic` in the current namespace.
Make also sure you have xref:latest@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] into the Kubernetes cluster you're connected to.

Save the `jms-amqp-10-sink-binding.yaml` file into your hard drive, then configure it according to your needs.

You can run the sink using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f jms-amqp-10-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Binding to Kafka using the Kamel CLI:*

The procedure described above can be simplified into a single execution of the `kamel bind` command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1:KafkaTopic:my-topic jms-amqp-10-sink -p "sink.brokerURL=amqp://k3s-node-master.usersys.redhat.com:31616" -p "sink.destinationName=The Destination Name"
----

This will create the KameletBinding under the hood and apply it to the current namespace in the cluster.

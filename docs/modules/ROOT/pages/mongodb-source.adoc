= image:kamelets/mongodb-source.svg[] MongoDB Source

*Provided by: "Apache Software Foundation"*

*Support Level for this Kamelet is: "Preview"*

Consume documents from MongoDB.

If the persistentTailTracking option will be enabled, the consumer will keep track of the last consumed message and on the next restart, the consumption will restart from that message. In case of persistentTailTracking enabled, the tailTrackIncreasingField must be provided (by default it is optional).

If the persistentTailTracking option won't be enabled, the consumer will consume the whole collection and wait in idle for new documents to consume.

== Configuration Options

The following table summarizes the configuration options available for the `mongodb-source` Kamelet:
[width="100%",cols="2,^2,3,^2,^2,^3",options="header"]
|===
| Property| Name| Description| Type| Default| Example
| *collection {empty}* *| MongoDB Collection| Sets the name of the MongoDB collection to bind to this endpoint.| string| | 
| *database {empty}* *| MongoDB Database| Sets the name of the MongoDB database to target.| string| | 
| *hosts {empty}* *| MongoDB Hosts| Comma separated list of MongoDB Host Addresses in host:port format.| string| | 
| *password {empty}* *| MongoDB Password| User password for accessing MongoDB.| string| | 
| *username {empty}* *| MongoDB Username| Username for accessing MongoDB.| string| | 
| persistentTailTracking| MongoDB Persistent Tail Tracking| Enable persistent tail tracking, which is a mechanism to keep track of the last consumed message across system restarts. The next time the system is up, the endpoint will recover the cursor from the point where it last stopped slurping records.| boolean| `false`| 
| tailTrackIncreasingField| MongoDB Tail Track Increasing Field| Correlation field in the incoming record which is of increasing nature and will be used to position the tailing cursor every time it is generated.| string| | 
|===

NOTE: Fields marked with ({empty}*) are mandatory.

== Usage

This section summarizes how the `mongodb-source` can be used in various contexts.

=== Knative Source

The `mongodb-source` Kamelet can be used as Knative source by binding it to a Knative object.

.mongodb-source-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: mongodb-source-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: mongodb-source
    properties:
      collection: "The MongoDB Collection"
      database: "The MongoDB Database"
      hosts: "The MongoDB Hosts"
      password: "The MongoDB Password"
      username: "The MongoDB Username"
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: InMemoryChannel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
  
----
Make sure you have xref:latest@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] into the Kubernetes cluster you're connected to.

Save the `mongodb-source-binding.yaml` file into your hard drive, then configure it according to your needs.

You can run the source using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f mongodb-source-binding.yaml
----

==== *Binding to Knative using the Kamel CLI:*

The procedure described above can be simplified into a single execution of the `kamel bind` command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind mongodb-source -p "source.collection=The MongoDB Collection" -p "source.database=The MongoDB Database" -p "source.hosts=The MongoDB Hosts" -p "source.password=The MongoDB Password" -p "source.username=The MongoDB Username" channel/mychannel
----

This will create the KameletBinding under the hood and apply it to the current namespace in the cluster.

=== Kafka Source

The `mongodb-source` Kamelet can be used as Kafka source by binding it to a Kafka topic.

.mongodb-source-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: mongodb-source-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: mongodb-source
    properties:
      collection: "The MongoDB Collection"
      database: "The MongoDB Database"
      hosts: "The MongoDB Hosts"
      password: "The MongoDB Password"
      username: "The MongoDB Username"
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: KafkaTopic
      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic
  
----

Ensure that you've installed https://strimzi.io/[Strimzi] and created a topic named `my-topic` in the current namespace.
Make also sure you have xref:latest@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] into the Kubernetes cluster you're connected to.

Save the `mongodb-source-binding.yaml` file into your hard drive, then configure it according to your needs.

You can run the source using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f mongodb-source-binding.yaml
----

==== *Binding to Kafka using the Kamel CLI:*

The procedure described above can be simplified into a single execution of the `kamel bind` command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind mongodb-source -p "source.collection=The MongoDB Collection" -p "source.database=The MongoDB Database" -p "source.hosts=The MongoDB Hosts" -p "source.password=The MongoDB Password" -p "source.username=The MongoDB Username" kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1:KafkaTopic:my-topic
----

This will create the KameletBinding under the hood and apply it to the current namespace in the cluster.

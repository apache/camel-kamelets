== Usage

This section summarizes how the `rabbitmq-source` can be used in various contexts.

=== Knative Source

The `rabbitmq-source` Kamelet can be used as Knative source by binding it to a Knative object.

.rabbitmq-source-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: rabbitmq-source-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: rabbitmq-source
    properties:
      addresses: "localhost:5672"
      exchangeName: "The Exchange name"
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: InMemoryChannel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
  
----
Make sure you have xref:latest@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] into the Kubernetes cluster you're connected to.

Save the `rabbitmq-source-binding.yaml` file into your hard drive, then configure it according to your needs.

You can run the source using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f rabbitmq-source-binding.yaml
----

==== *Dependencies*

The Kamelet needs the following dependencies:

camel:rabbitmqcamel:kamelet 

==== *Binding to Knative using the Kamel CLI:*

The procedure described above can be simplified into a single execution of the `kamel bind` command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind rabbitmq-source -p "source.addresses=localhost:5672" -p "source.exchangeName=The Exchange name" channel/mychannel
----

This will create the KameletBinding under the hood and apply it to the current namespace in the cluster.

=== Kafka Source

The `rabbitmq-source` Kamelet can be used as Kafka source by binding it to a Kafka topic.

.rabbitmq-source-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: rabbitmq-source-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: rabbitmq-source
    properties:
      addresses: "localhost:5672"
      exchangeName: "The Exchange name"
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: KafkaTopic
      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic
  
----

Ensure that you've installed https://strimzi.io/[Strimzi] and created a topic named `my-topic` in the current namespace.
Make also sure you have xref:latest@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] into the Kubernetes cluster you're connected to.

Save the `rabbitmq-source-binding.yaml` file into your hard drive, then configure it according to your needs.

You can run the source using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f rabbitmq-source-binding.yaml
----

==== *Binding to Kafka using the Kamel CLI:*

The procedure described above can be simplified into a single execution of the `kamel bind` command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind rabbitmq-source -p "source.addresses=localhost:5672" -p "source.exchangeName=The Exchange name" kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1:KafkaTopic:my-topic
----

This will create the KameletBinding under the hood and apply it to the current namespace in the cluster.

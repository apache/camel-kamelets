== Usage

This section describes how you can use the `google-mail-source`.

=== Knative Source

You can use the `google-mail-source` Kamelet as a Knative source by binding it to a Knative object.

.google-mail-source-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: google-mail-source-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: google-mail-source
    properties:
      accessToken: "The Access Token"
      applicationName: "The Application name"
      clientId: "The Client ID"
      clientSecret: "The Client Secret"
      index: "The Index"
      refreshToken: "The Refresh Token"
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Channel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
  
----

==== *Prerequisite*

You have xref:next@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] on the cluster.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `google-mail-source-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the source by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f google-mail-source-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the source by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind google-mail-source -p "source.accessToken=The Access Token" -p "source.applicationName=The Application name" -p "source.clientId=The Client ID" -p "source.clientSecret=The Client Secret" -p "source.index=The Index" -p "source.refreshToken=The Refresh Token" channel:mychannel
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.

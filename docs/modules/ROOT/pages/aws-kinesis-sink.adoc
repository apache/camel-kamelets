*Provided by: "Apache Software Foundation"*

*Support Level for this Kamelet is: "Preview"*

Send data to AWS Kinesis.

The Kamelet expects the following header:

- `partition` / `ce-partition`: to set the Kinesis partition key

If the header won't be set the exchange ID will be used.

The Kamelet is also able to recognize the following header:

- `sequence-number` / `ce-sequencenumber`: to set the Sequence number

This header is optional.

== Configuration Options

The following table summarizes the configuration options available for the `aws-kinesis-sink` Kamelet:
[width="100%",cols="2,^2,3,^2,^2,^3",options="header"]
|===
| Property| Name| Description| Type| Default| Example
| *accessKey {empty}* *| Access Key| The access key obtained from AWS| string| | 
| *region {empty}* *| AWS Region| The AWS region to connect to| string| | `"eu-west-1"`
| *secretKey {empty}* *| Secret Key| The secret key obtained from AWS| string| | 
| *stream {empty}* *| Stream Name| The Kinesis stream that you want to access (needs to be created in advance)| string| | 
|===

NOTE: Fields marked with ({empty}*) are mandatory.

== Usage

This section summarizes how the `aws-kinesis-sink` can be used in various contexts.

=== Knative Sink

The `aws-kinesis-sink` Kamelet can be used as Knative sink by binding it to a Knative object.

.aws-kinesis-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: aws-kinesis-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Channel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: aws-kinesis-sink
    properties:
      accessKey: "The Access Key"
      region: "eu-west-1"
      secretKey: "The Secret Key"
      stream: "The Stream Name"
  
----
Make sure you have xref:latest@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] into the Kubernetes cluster you're connected to.

Save the `aws-kinesis-sink-binding.yaml` file into your hard drive, then configure it according to your needs.

You can run the sink using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f aws-kinesis-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Dependencies*

The Kamelet needs the following dependencies:

- camel:aws2-kinesis
- camel:kamelet 

==== *Binding to Knative using the Kamel CLI:*

The procedure described above can be simplified into a single execution of the `kamel bind` command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind channel:mychannel aws-kinesis-sink -p "sink.accessKey=The Access Key" -p "sink.region=eu-west-1" -p "sink.secretKey=The Secret Key" -p "sink.stream=The Stream Name"
----

This will create the KameletBinding under the hood and apply it to the current namespace in the cluster.

=== Kafka Sink

The `aws-kinesis-sink` Kamelet can be used as Kafka sink by binding it to a Kafka topic.

.aws-kinesis-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: aws-kinesis-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: KafkaTopic
      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: aws-kinesis-sink
    properties:
      accessKey: "The Access Key"
      region: "eu-west-1"
      secretKey: "The Secret Key"
      stream: "The Stream Name"
  
----

Ensure that you've installed https://strimzi.io/[Strimzi] and created a topic named `my-topic` in the current namespace.
Make also sure you have xref:latest@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] into the Kubernetes cluster you're connected to.

Save the `aws-kinesis-sink-binding.yaml` file into your hard drive, then configure it according to your needs.

You can run the sink using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f aws-kinesis-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Binding to Kafka using the Kamel CLI:*

The procedure described above can be simplified into a single execution of the `kamel bind` command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1:KafkaTopic:my-topic aws-kinesis-sink -p "sink.accessKey=The Access Key" -p "sink.region=eu-west-1" -p "sink.secretKey=The Secret Key" -p "sink.stream=The Stream Name"
----

This will create the KameletBinding under the hood and apply it to the current namespace in the cluster.

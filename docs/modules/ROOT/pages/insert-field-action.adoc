= image:kamelets/insert-field-action.svg[] Insert Field Action

*Provided by: "Apache Software Foundation"*

*Support Level for this Kamelet is: "Preview"*

Adds a custom field with a constant value to the message in transit.

This action works with Json Object. So it will expect a Json Array or a Json Object.

If for example you have an array like '{ "foo":"John", "bar":30 }' and your action has been configured with field as 'element' and value as 'hello', you'll get '{ "foo":"John", "bar":30, "element":"hello" }'

No headers mapping supported, only constant values.

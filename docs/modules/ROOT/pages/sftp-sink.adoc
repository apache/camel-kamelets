*Provided by: "Apache Software Foundation"*

*Support Level for this Kamelet is: "Preview"*

Send data to an SFTP Server.

If the header won't be set the exchange ID will be used as file name.

| *directoryName {empty}* *| Directory Name| The starting directory| string| | 
| *password {empty}* *| Password| The password to access the FTP server| string| | 
| *username {empty}* *| Username| The username to access the FTP server| string| | 
| fileExist| File Existence| How to behave in case of file already existent. There are 4 enums and the value can be one of Override, Append, Fail or Ignore| string| `"Override"`| 
| passiveMode| Passive Mode| Sets passive mode connection| boolean| `false`|

NOTE: Fields marked with ({empty}*) are mandatory.

== Usage

This section summarizes how the `sftp-sink` can be used in various contexts.

=== Knative Sink

The `sftp-sink` Kamelet can be used as Knative sink by binding it to a Knative object.

.sftp-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: sftp-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: InMemoryChannel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: sftp-sink
    properties:
      connectionHost: "The Connection Host"
      directoryName: "The Directory Name"
      password: "The Password"
      username: "The Username"
  
----
Make sure you have xref:latest@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] into the Kubernetes cluster you're connected to.

Save the `sftp-sink-binding.yaml` file into your hard drive, then configure it according to your needs.

You can run the sink using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f sftp-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Dependencies*

The Kamelet needs the following dependencies:

- camel:ftp
- camel:core
- camel:kamelet 

==== *Binding to Knative using the Kamel CLI:*

The procedure described above can be simplified into a single execution of the `kamel bind` command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind channel:mychannel sftp-sink -p "sink.connectionHost=The Connection Host" -p "sink.directoryName=The Directory Name" -p "sink.password=The Password" -p "sink.username=The Username"
----

This will create the KameletBinding under the hood and apply it to the current namespace in the cluster.

=== Kafka Sink

The `sftp-sink` Kamelet can be used as Kafka sink by binding it to a Kafka topic.

.sftp-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: sftp-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: KafkaTopic
      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: sftp-sink
    properties:
      connectionHost: "The Connection Host"
      directoryName: "The Directory Name"
      password: "The Password"
      username: "The Username"
  
----

Ensure that you've installed https://strimzi.io/[Strimzi] and created a topic named `my-topic` in the current namespace.
Make also sure you have xref:latest@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] into the Kubernetes cluster you're connected to.

Save the `sftp-sink-binding.yaml` file into your hard drive, then configure it according to your needs.

You can run the sink using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f sftp-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Binding to Kafka using the Kamel CLI:*

The procedure described above can be simplified into a single execution of the `kamel bind` command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1:KafkaTopic:my-topic sftp-sink -p "sink.connectionHost=The Connection Host" -p "sink.directoryName=The Directory Name" -p "sink.password=The Password" -p "sink.username=The Username"
----

This will create the KameletBinding under the hood and apply it to the current namespace in the cluster.

*Provided by: "Apache Software Foundation"*

*Support Level for this Kamelet is: "Preview"*

Execute system commands

The Kamelet expects the following headers to be set:

- `args` / `ce-args`: as the args to be set on the executable.

If the header won't be set the executable will be run without arguments.

== Configuration Options

The following table summarizes the configuration options available for the `exec-sink` Kamelet:
[width="100%",cols="2,^2,3,^2,^2,^3",options="header"]
|===
| Property| Name| Description| Type| Default| Example
| *executable {empty}* *| Executable Command| The command to execute| string| | 
|===

NOTE: Fields marked with ({empty}*) are mandatory.

== Usage

This section summarizes how the `exec-sink` can be used in various contexts.

=== Knative Sink

The `exec-sink` Kamelet can be used as Knative sink by binding it to a Knative object.

.exec-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: exec-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: InMemoryChannel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: exec-sink
    properties:
      executable: "The Executable Command"
  
----
Make sure you have xref:latest@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] into the Kubernetes cluster you're connected to.

Save the `exec-sink-binding.yaml` file into your hard drive, then configure it according to your needs.

You can run the sink using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f exec-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Dependencies*

The Kamelet needs the following dependencies:


- camel:core

- camel:exec

- camel:kamelet
 

==== *Binding to Knative using the Kamel CLI:*

The procedure described above can be simplified into a single execution of the `kamel bind` command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind channel/mychannel exec-sink -p "sink.executable=The Executable Command"
----

This will create the KameletBinding under the hood and apply it to the current namespace in the cluster.

=== Kafka Sink

The `exec-sink` Kamelet can be used as Kafka sink by binding it to a Kafka topic.

.exec-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: exec-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: KafkaTopic
      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: exec-sink
    properties:
      executable: "The Executable Command"
  
----

Ensure that you've installed https://strimzi.io/[Strimzi] and created a topic named `my-topic` in the current namespace.
Make also sure you have xref:latest@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] into the Kubernetes cluster you're connected to.

Save the `exec-sink-binding.yaml` file into your hard drive, then configure it according to your needs.

You can run the sink using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f exec-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Binding to Kafka using the Kamel CLI:*

The procedure described above can be simplified into a single execution of the `kamel bind` command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1:KafkaTopic:my-topic exec-sink -p "sink.executable=The Executable Command"
----

This will create the KameletBinding under the hood and apply it to the current namespace in the cluster.

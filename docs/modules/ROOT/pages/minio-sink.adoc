*Provided by: "Apache Software Foundation"*

*Support Level for this Kamelet is: "Preview"*

Upload data to Minio.

The Kamelet expects the following headers to be set:

- `file` / `ce-file`: as the file name to upload

If the header won't be set the exchange ID will be used as file name.

== Configuration Options

The following table summarizes the configuration options available for the `minio-sink` Kamelet:
[width="100%",cols="2,^2,3,^2,^2,^3",options="header"]
|===
| Property| Name| Description| Type| Default| Example
| *accessKey {empty}* *| Access Key| The access key obtained from Minio| string| | 
| *bucketName {empty}* *| Bucket Name| The Minio Bucket name| string| | 
| *endpoint {empty}* *| Endpoint| The Minio Endpoint, it can be an URL, domain name, IPv4 address or IPv6 address.| string| | `"http://localhost:9000"`
| *secretKey {empty}* *| Secret Key| The secret key obtained from Minio| string| | 
| autoCreateBucket| Autocreate Bucket| Setting the autocreation of the Minio bucket bucketName.| boolean| `false`| 
|===

NOTE: Fields marked with ({empty}*) are mandatory.

== Usage

This section summarizes how the `minio-sink` can be used in various contexts.

=== Knative Sink

The `minio-sink` Kamelet can be used as Knative sink by binding it to a Knative object.

.minio-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: minio-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Channel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: minio-sink
    properties:
      accessKey: "The Access Key"
      bucketName: "The Bucket Name"
      endpoint: "http://localhost:9000"
      secretKey: "The Secret Key"
  
----
Make sure you have xref:latest@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] into the Kubernetes cluster you're connected to.

Save the `minio-sink-binding.yaml` file into your hard drive, then configure it according to your needs.

You can run the sink using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f minio-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Dependencies*

The Kamelet needs the following dependencies:

- camel:minio
- camel:kamelet 

==== *Binding to Knative using the Kamel CLI:*

The procedure described above can be simplified into a single execution of the `kamel bind` command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind channel:mychannel minio-sink -p "sink.accessKey=The Access Key" -p "sink.bucketName=The Bucket Name" -p "sink.endpoint=http://localhost:9000" -p "sink.secretKey=The Secret Key"
----

This will create the KameletBinding under the hood and apply it to the current namespace in the cluster.

=== Kafka Sink

The `minio-sink` Kamelet can be used as Kafka sink by binding it to a Kafka topic.

.minio-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: minio-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: KafkaTopic
      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: minio-sink
    properties:
      accessKey: "The Access Key"
      bucketName: "The Bucket Name"
      endpoint: "http://localhost:9000"
      secretKey: "The Secret Key"
  
----

Ensure that you've installed https://strimzi.io/[Strimzi] and created a topic named `my-topic` in the current namespace.
Make also sure you have xref:latest@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] into the Kubernetes cluster you're connected to.

Save the `minio-sink-binding.yaml` file into your hard drive, then configure it according to your needs.

You can run the sink using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f minio-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Binding to Kafka using the Kamel CLI:*

The procedure described above can be simplified into a single execution of the `kamel bind` command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1:KafkaTopic:my-topic minio-sink -p "sink.accessKey=The Access Key" -p "sink.bucketName=The Bucket Name" -p "sink.endpoint=http://localhost:9000" -p "sink.secretKey=The Secret Key"
----

This will create the KameletBinding under the hood and apply it to the current namespace in the cluster.

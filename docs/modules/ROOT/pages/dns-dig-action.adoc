= image:kamelets/dns-dig-action.svg[] DNS DIG Action

*Provided by: "Apache Software Foundation"*

*Support Level for this Kamelet is: "Preview"*

Query a DNS through Dig

The Kamelet expects the following headers to be set:

- `domain-name` / `ce-domainname`: as the domain for which we are querying the DNS

- `dns-type` / `ce-dnstype`: as the DNS type

If the domain-name header won't be set the body will be used as domain name.

If the dns-type header won't be set, the DNS Type A will be used.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `dns-dig-action-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the action by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f dns-dig-action-binding.yaml

*Provided by: "Apache Software Foundation"*

Query a DNS through Dig

The Kamelet expects the following headers to be set:

- `domain-name` / `ce-domain-name`: as the domain for which we are querying the DNS

- `dns-type` / `ce-dns-type`: as the DNS type

If the domain-name header won't be set the body will be used as domain name.

If the dns-type header won't be set, the DNS Type A will be used.

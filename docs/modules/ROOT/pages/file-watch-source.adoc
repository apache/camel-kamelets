=== Knative Source

You can use the `file-watch-source` Kamelet as a Knative source by binding it to a Knative object.

.file-watch-source-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: file-watch-source-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1

== Usage

This section describes how you can use the `solr-sink`.

=== Knative Sink

You can use the `solr-sink` Kamelet as a Knative sink by binding it to a Knative object.

.solr-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: solr-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Channel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: solr-sink
    properties:
      collection: "The Collection"
      servers: "The Servers"
  
----

==== *Prerequisite*

You have xref:{camel-k-version}@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] on the cluster.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `solr-sink-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the sink by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f solr-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the sink by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind channel:mychannel solr-sink -p "sink.collection=The Collection" -p "sink.servers=The Servers"
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.

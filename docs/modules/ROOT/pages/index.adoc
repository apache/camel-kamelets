= Kamelet Catalog

This page contains the default Apache Camel Kamelets catalog.
**We love contributions for this catalog**: you can follow the xref:latest@camel-k::kamelets/kamelets-dev.adoc[Kamelets Developer Guide]
for information on how to create new Kamelets and contribute them to the official https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets/[github.com/apache/camel-kamelets] repository.

//The `relative=!nav.adoc` filter is needed only to work around a bug or limitation in xref-checker.
//The filter should be removed when xref-checker is no longer used (i.e. Antora 3 alpha.9 upgrade is complete).

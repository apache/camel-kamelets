= image:kamelets/dns-ip-action.svg[] DNS IP Action

*Provided by: "Apache Software Foundation"*

*Support Level for this Kamelet is: "Preview"*

Get an IP from a DNS

The Kamelet expects the following headers to be set:

- `domain` / `ce-domain`: as the domain for which we are looking for the IP

If the header won't be set the body will be used as domain to look for.

== Configuration Options

The Kamelet does not specify any configuration option.

== Usage

This section summarizes how the `dns-ip-action` can be used in various contexts.

=== Knative Action

The `dns-ip-action` Kamelet can be used as intermediate step in a Knative binding.

apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1

  name: dns-ip-action-binding

  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet

----
Make sure you have xref:latest@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] into the Kubernetes cluster you're connected to.

Save the `dns-ip-action-binding.yaml` file into your hard drive, then configure it according to your needs.

You can run the action using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f dns-ip-action-binding.yaml
----

==== *Dependencies*

The Kamelet needs the following dependencies:


- camel:dns
- camel:kamelet 

==== *Binding to Knative using the Kamel CLI:*

The procedure described above can be simplified into a single execution of the `kamel bind` command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind timer-source?message=Hello --step dns-ip-action channel/mychannel
----

This will create the KameletBinding under the hood and apply it to the current namespace in the cluster.

=== Kafka Action

The `dns-ip-action` Kamelet can be used as intermediate step in a Kafka binding.

apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: dns-ip-action-binding

  sink:
    ref:
      kind: KafkaTopic
      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic

----

Ensure that you've installed https://strimzi.io/[Strimzi] and created a topic named `my-topic` in the current namespace.
Make also sure you have xref:latest@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] into the Kubernetes cluster you're connected to.

Save the `dns-ip-action-binding.yaml` file into your hard drive, then configure it according to your needs.

You can run the action using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f dns-ip-action-binding.yaml

==== *Binding to Kafka using the Kamel CLI:*

The procedure described above can be simplified into a single execution of the `kamel bind` command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind timer-source?message=Hello --step dns-ip-action kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1:KafkaTopic:my-topic
----

This will create the KameletBinding under the hood and apply it to the current namespace in the cluster.

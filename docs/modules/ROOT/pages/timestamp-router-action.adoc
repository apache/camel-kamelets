[width="100%",cols="2,^2,3,^2,^2,^3",options="header"]
|===

| timestampFormat| Timestamp Format| Format string for the timestamp that is compatible with java.text.SimpleDateFormat.| string| `"yyyyMMdd"`| 
| timestampHeaderName| Timestamp Header Name| The name of the header containing a timestamp| string| `"kafka.TIMESTAMP"`| 
| topicFormat| Topic Format| Format string which can contain '$[topic]' and '$[timestamp]' as placeholders for the topic and timestamp, respectively.| string| `"topic-$[timestamp]"`| 
|===

NOTE: Fields marked with ({empty}*) are mandatory.

== Usage

This section summarizes how the `timestamp-router-action` can be used in various contexts.

=== Knative Action

The `timestamp-router-action` Kamelet can be used as intermediate step in a Knative binding.

.timestamp-router-action-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: timestamp-router-action-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: timer-source
    properties:
      message: "Hello"
  steps:
  - ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: timestamp-router-action
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: InMemoryChannel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel

----

Make sure you have xref:latest@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] into the Kubernetes cluster you're connected to.

Save the `timestamp-router-action-binding.yaml` file into your hard drive, then configure it according to your needs.

You can run the action using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f timestamp-router-action-binding.yaml
----

==== *Binding to Knative using the Kamel CLI:*

The procedure described above can be simplified into a single execution of the `kamel bind` command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind timer-source?message=Hello --step timestamp-router-action channel/mychannel
----

This will create the KameletBinding under the hood and apply it to the current namespace in the cluster.

=== Kafka Action

The `timestamp-router-action` Kamelet can be used as intermediate step in a Kafka binding.

.timestamp-router-action-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: timestamp-router-action-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: timer-source
    properties:
      message: "Hello"
  steps:
  - ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: timestamp-router-action
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: KafkaTopic
      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic

----

Ensure that you've installed https://strimzi.io/[Strimzi] and created a topic named `my-topic` in the current namespace.
Make also sure you have xref:latest@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] into the Kubernetes cluster you're connected to.

Save the `timestamp-router-action-binding.yaml` file into your hard drive, then configure it according to your needs.

You can run the action using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f timestamp-router-action-binding.yaml
----

==== *Binding to Kafka using the Kamel CLI:*

The procedure described above can be simplified into a single execution of the `kamel bind` command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind timer-source?message=Hello --step timestamp-router-action kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1:KafkaTopic:my-topic
----

This will create the KameletBinding under the hood and apply it to the current namespace in the cluster.

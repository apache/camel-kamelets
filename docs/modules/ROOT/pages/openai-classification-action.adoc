*Provided by: "Apache Software Foundation"*

*Support Level for this Kamelet is: "Preview"*

Classifies a sentence using the OpenAI API.

It requires an OpenAI account (beta accounts available at https://beta.openai.com/).

Training data for classification can be provided in advance by uploading a file with purpose="classifications", see: https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/files/upload.

The Kamelet accepts data in:

- `text/plain` format (default)
- `application/json` format: see reference at https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/classifications/create

== Usage

This section summarizes how the `openai-classification-action` can be used in various contexts.

=== Knative Action

The `openai-classification-action` Kamelet can be used as intermediate step in a Knative binding.

.openai-classification-action-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: openai-classification-action-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: timer-source
    properties:
      message: "Hello"
  steps:
  - ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: openai-classification-action
    properties:
      authorizationToken: "The Authorization Token"
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: InMemoryChannel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel

----
Make sure you have xref:latest@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] into the Kubernetes cluster you're connected to.

Save the `openai-classification-action-binding.yaml` file into your hard drive, then configure it according to your needs.

You can run the action using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f openai-classification-action-binding.yaml
----

==== *Dependencies*

The Kamelet needs the following dependencies:

github:apache.camel-kamelets:camel-kamelets-utils:main-SNAPSHOTcamel:jacksoncamel:jsonpathcamel:corecamel:kameletcamel:http 

==== *Binding to Knative using the Kamel CLI:*

The procedure described above can be simplified into a single execution of the `kamel bind` command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind timer-source?message=Hello --step openai-classification-action -p "step-0.authorizationToken=The Authorization Token" channel/mychannel
----

This will create the KameletBinding under the hood and apply it to the current namespace in the cluster.

=== Kafka Action

The `openai-classification-action` Kamelet can be used as intermediate step in a Kafka binding.

.openai-classification-action-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: openai-classification-action-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: timer-source
    properties:
      message: "Hello"
  steps:
  - ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: openai-classification-action
    properties:
      authorizationToken: "The Authorization Token"
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: KafkaTopic
      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic

----

Ensure that you've installed https://strimzi.io/[Strimzi] and created a topic named `my-topic` in the current namespace.
Make also sure you have xref:latest@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] into the Kubernetes cluster you're connected to.

Save the `openai-classification-action-binding.yaml` file into your hard drive, then configure it according to your needs.

You can run the action using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f openai-classification-action-binding.yaml
----

==== *Binding to Kafka using the Kamel CLI:*

The procedure described above can be simplified into a single execution of the `kamel bind` command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind timer-source?message=Hello --step openai-classification-action -p "step-0.authorizationToken=The Authorization Token" kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1:KafkaTopic:my-topic
----

This will create the KameletBinding under the hood and apply it to the current namespace in the cluster.

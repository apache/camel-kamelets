== Usage

This section describes how you can use the `cron-source`.

=== Knative Source

You can use the `cron-source` Kamelet as a Knative source by binding it to a Knative object.

.cron-source-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: cron-source-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: cron-source
    properties:
      message: "hello world"
      schedule: "0/3 10 * * * ?"
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Channel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
  
----

==== *Prerequisite*

You have xref:next@camel-k::installation/installation.adoc[Camel K installed] on the cluster.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `cron-source-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the source by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f cron-source-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the source by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind cron-source -p "source.message=hello world" -p "source.schedule=0/3 10 * * * ?" channel:mychannel
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.

== MariaDB Sink Kamelet Description

=== Database Connection

This Kamelet connects to MariaDB databases using JDBC. MariaDB is a popular open-source relational database management system that is a compatible drop-in replacement for MySQL.

=== Data Processing

The Kamelet expects JSON input data which is unmarshalled before executing the SQL query. The input data fields can be referenced in the SQL query using named parameters.

=== Query Configuration

The SQL query should use named parameters (e.g., `:#username`, `:#city`) that correspond to fields in the incoming JSON data. This allows for safe parameterized queries that prevent SQL injection attacks.

=== Connection Pooling

The Kamelet uses Apache Commons DBCP2 for connection pooling, providing efficient database connection management and resource optimization.

=== Authentication

Requires username and password authentication for secure database access. These credentials should be properly managed and secured.

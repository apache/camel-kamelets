== MySQL Source Kamelet Description

=== Authentication

=== Configuration

The MySQL Source Kamelet supports the following configurations:

- **Server Name**: The hostname or IP address of the MySQL server (required)
- **Username**: Username for database authentication (required)
- **Password**: Password for database authentication (required)
- **Query**: SQL query to execute (required)
- **Database Name**: Name of the MySQL database (required)
- **Server Port**: Port number for the MySQL server (default: 3306)
- **Period**: Interval between query executions in milliseconds
- **Connection Properties**: Additional JDBC connection properties

=== Output Format

The Kamelet outputs query results as JSON objects. Each row from the result set is converted to a JSON object with column names as keys.

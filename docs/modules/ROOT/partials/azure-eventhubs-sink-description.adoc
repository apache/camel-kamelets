== Azure Event Hubs Sink Kamelet Description

=== Authentication methods

In this Kamelet you have the possibility of using the Azure Identity mechanism or the plain Shared Account Key. Respectively the parameters are `AZURE_IDENTITY` and `CONNECTION_STRING`

The order of evaluation for `AZURE_IDENTITY` is the following:

 - Enviroment
 - Workload Identity 
 - Managed Identity 
 - Azure Developer CLI 
 - IntelliJ
 - Azure CLI
 - Azure Powershell

For more information about this you can look at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/api/overview/azure/identity-readme[Azure Identity documentation]

=== Optional Headers

In the headers, you can optionally set the `partition-id` / `ce-partition-id` property to specify the partition id for a specific item.

If you do not set the property in the header, Azure Event Hubs will do that for you.

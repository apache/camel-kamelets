=== Caching and Session Storage

Commonly used for caching frequently accessed data and session storage in web applications, providing fast data retrieval and improved application performance.

=== Persistence Options

Redis offers configurable persistence options including:

- RDB snapshots for point-in-time backups
- AOF (Append Only File) for durability
- Hybrid persistence combining both approaches

=== High Availability

Supports Redis Sentinel for high availability and Redis Cluster for horizontal scaling and automatic failover capabilities.

=== Use Cases

Ideal for scenarios requiring:

- Fast data access and caching
- Real-time analytics and counters
- Session management
- Pub/sub messaging patterns

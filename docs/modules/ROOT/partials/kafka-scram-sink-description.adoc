== Kafka Scram Sink Kamelet Description

=== SCRAM Authentication

This Kamelet uses SCRAM (Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism) for secure authentication with Kafka brokers. SCRAM provides a secure method for username/password authentication.

=== Authentication Mechanism

The Kamelet supports SCRAM-SHA-512 by default, which provides strong cryptographic security. The authentication mechanism can be configured based on the Kafka broker's security configuration.

=== Security Protocol

Uses SASL_SSL security protocol by default, ensuring both authentication and encryption for data in transit. This provides comprehensive security for Kafka communications.

=== Credential Management

Requires username and password credentials that should be securely managed and rotated according to security best practices.

=== Production Ready

This Kamelet is suitable for production environments requiring secure authentication without the complexity of certificate-based authentication.

This Kamelet integrates with Salesforce CRM using composite upsert operations. Composite operations allow multiple records to be processed in a single API call, improving efficiency and reducing API usage.

=== Upsert Operations

Performs upsert (insert or update) operations that create new records if they don't exist or update existing records based on external ID fields. This provides flexible data synchronization capabilities.

=== Batch Processing

Composite operations enable batch processing of multiple records in a single request, reducing API call overhead and improving performance for bulk data operations.

=== External ID Matching

Uses external ID fields for record matching, allowing integration with external systems while maintaining data relationships and avoiding duplicate records.

=== API Efficiency

Salesforce composite operations optimize API usage by:

- Reducing the number of API calls
- Minimizing network round trips
- Improving overall integration performance
- Supporting bulk data operations

=== Error Handling

Provides detailed error information for each record in the composite operation, enabling granular error handling and data quality management.

== Snowflake Sink Kamelet Description

=== Cloud Data Warehouse

This Kamelet integrates with Snowflake, a cloud-based data warehouse platform that provides scalable data storage and analytics capabilities. Snowflake is designed for modern data architecture and cloud-native applications.

=== JDBC Connectivity

Uses the Snowflake JDBC driver for native connectivity to Snowflake instances. The driver provides optimized performance and supports Snowflake-specific features and data types.

=== Instance Configuration

Requires configuration of the Snowflake instance URL (e.g., `instance.snowflakecomputing.com`) which uniquely identifies your Snowflake account and region.

=== Data Processing

Processes JSON input data through unmarshalling before executing SQL queries. This enables seamless integration with JSON-based data pipelines and streaming applications.

=== Query Execution

Supports parameterized SQL queries using named parameters that map to JSON data fields. This ensures secure and efficient data insertion into Snowflake tables.

=== Cloud-Native Features

Snowflake's cloud-native architecture provides automatic scaling, performance optimization, and enterprise-grade security, making this Kamelet suitable for large-scale data operations.

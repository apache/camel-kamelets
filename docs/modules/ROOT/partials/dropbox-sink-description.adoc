== Dropbox Sink Kamelet Description

=== Authentication

This Kamelet uses OAuth 2.0 access token authentication to connect to Dropbox. You need to provide:
- Access Token: OAuth access token from Dropbox
- Client Identifier: Your Dropbox App client identifier

=== File Upload Configuration

The Kamelet uploads files to a specified remote path on Dropbox with configurable upload modes:
- `add`: Renames the new file if a file with the same name exists
- `force`: Overwrites the existing file

=== Optional Headers

In the header, you can optionally set the `file` / `ce-file` property to specify the name of the file to upload.

If you do not set the property in the header, the Kamelet uses a default naming convention.

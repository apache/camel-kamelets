== Oracle Database Sink Kamelet Description

=== Enterprise Database Integration

This Kamelet provides integration with Oracle Database, a leading enterprise-grade relational database management system known for its performance, reliability, and advanced features.

=== JDBC Connectivity

Uses Oracle's thin JDBC driver for efficient database connectivity. The thin driver provides a pure Java implementation that doesn't require Oracle client software installation.

=== Data Processing

Expects JSON input data which is unmarshalled before SQL execution. The JSON data fields can be referenced in SQL queries using named parameters for secure data binding.

=== Query Parameterization

Supports named parameters in SQL queries (e.g., `:#username`, `:#city`) that correspond to incoming JSON data fields. This provides secure, injection-resistant query execution.

=== Connection Pooling

Utilizes Apache Commons DBCP2 for connection pooling, ensuring efficient resource management and optimal database performance in enterprise environments.

=== Enterprise Features

Oracle Database supports advanced features like transactions, stored procedures, and complex data types, making this Kamelet suitable for enterprise-level applications.

== MQTT Sink Kamelet Description

=== MQTT Protocol

This Kamelet implements the MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol, a lightweight messaging protocol designed for IoT devices and applications with limited bandwidth or unreliable network connections.

=== Broker Integration

Connects to MQTT brokers using configurable broker URLs. Supports various MQTT brokers including Eclipse Mosquitto, HiveMQ, and cloud-based MQTT services.

=== Publish-Subscribe Pattern

Enables publish-subscribe messaging by sending messages to MQTT topics. This pattern allows for decoupled communication between message producers and consumers.

=== Authentication

Optional username and password authentication for secure broker connections. Suitable for both open and secured MQTT broker deployments.

=== IoT and Mobile Applications

MQTT's lightweight nature makes it ideal for:

- IoT device communication
- Mobile applications with limited bandwidth
- Unreliable network scenarios
- Battery-powered devices requiring minimal overhead

=== Quality of Service

MQTT supports different Quality of Service levels for message delivery guarantees, though this Kamelet uses the default QoS settings provided by the underlying MQTT client.

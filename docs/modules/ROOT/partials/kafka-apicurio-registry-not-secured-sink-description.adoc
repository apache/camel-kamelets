== Kafka Not Secured with Apicurio Registry Sink Kamelet Description

=== Schema Registry Integration

This Kamelet integrates with Apicurio Registry for schema management and serialization of Avro data. The registry provides centralized schema storage and versioning capabilities.

=== Avro Serialization

The Kamelet uses Avro serialization with configurable datum providers for efficient data serialization. The default serializer is configured for Avro data format with reflect-based datum provider.

=== Message Headers

The Kamelet supports both standard and CloudEvents headers for message keys and partition routing:

- Message key headers: `key` or `ce-key`
- Partition key headers: `partition-key` or `ce-partitionkey`

=== Security Note

This Kamelet connects to an insecure Kafka broker without authentication. Use appropriate secured variants for production environments.

== MySQL Sink Kamelet Description

=== Database Connection

This Kamelet connects to MySQL databases using the MySQL Connector/J JDBC driver. MySQL is one of the world's most popular open-source relational database management systems.

=== Data Processing

The Kamelet expects JSON input data which is automatically unmarshalled before executing the SQL query. This allows for seamless integration with JSON-based data sources.

=== Parameterized Queries

SQL queries use named parameters (e.g., `:#username`, `:#city`) that map to fields in the incoming JSON data. This approach provides protection against SQL injection attacks while maintaining query flexibility.

=== Connection Management

Uses Apache Commons DBCP2 for efficient database connection pooling. This provides optimal resource utilization and connection lifecycle management.

=== Authentication and Security

Requires username and password authentication for database access. The Kamelet uses the latest MySQL JDBC driver which supports modern security features and protocols.

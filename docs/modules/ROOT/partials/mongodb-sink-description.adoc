== MongoDB Sink Kamelet Description

=== NoSQL Database Integration

This Kamelet integrates with MongoDB, a popular NoSQL document database. MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, making it ideal for applications requiring dynamic schemas.

=== SSL/TLS Security

The Kamelet supports SSL/TLS encryption for secure connections to MongoDB. SSL is enabled by default, and certificate validation can be configured based on security requirements.

=== Authentication

Optional username and password authentication is supported for secured MongoDB instances. The Kamelet uses SSL-aware MongoDB client connections for secure data transmission.

=== Write Operations

The Kamelet performs insert operations into the specified collection. It supports upsert operations through header configuration (`db-upsert` or `ce-dbupsert` headers).

=== Write Concerns

Configurable write concern levels ensure data durability and consistency based on application requirements. Options include acknowledged, journaled, majority, and various numbered write concerns.

=== Collection Management

The Kamelet can optionally create collections during initialization if they don't exist, providing flexibility for dynamic database structures.

== Minio Sink Kamelet Description

=== Object Storage Integration

This Kamelet integrates with MinIO, an open-source object storage system that is compatible with Amazon S3 APIs. MinIO is ideal for cloud-native applications and data lake architectures.

=== S3-Compatible API

MinIO provides S3-compatible APIs, making it easy to migrate from Amazon S3 or integrate with S3-compatible applications and tools.

=== Authentication

Uses access key and secret key authentication for secure access to MinIO instances. These credentials should be properly managed and secured according to security best practices.

=== Bucket Management

The Kamelet can optionally auto-create buckets if they don't exist, providing flexibility for dynamic storage scenarios. Objects are stored with configurable key names.

=== Object Naming

Object names can be specified through configuration or derived from message headers (`file` or `ce-file`). If no name is provided, the exchange ID is used as the object name.

=== Deployment Flexibility

Supports various deployment scenarios including on-premises, cloud, and hybrid environments with configurable endpoint URLs.

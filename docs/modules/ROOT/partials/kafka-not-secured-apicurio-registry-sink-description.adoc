== Kafka Not Secured with Apicurio Registry secured with Keycloak Sink Kamelet Description

=== Schema Registry Security

This Kamelet integrates with Apicurio Registry that is secured with Keycloak authentication. While the Kafka broker connection is not secured, the schema registry access requires proper authentication.

=== Keycloak Authentication

The Kamelet supports OAuth2/OpenID Connect authentication through Keycloak for accessing the Apicurio Registry. Configuration includes:

- Keycloak service URL and realm
- Client ID and client secret
- Username and password for authentication

=== Avro Serialization

Uses Apicurio Registry's Avro serializer with configurable datum providers for efficient schema-based data serialization.

=== Security Considerations

While the Kafka broker connection is not secured, the schema registry authentication ensures that only authorized applications can access and modify schemas.

== Kafka SSL Sink Kamelet Description

=== TLS/SSL Encryption

This Kamelet provides secure communication with Kafka brokers using TLS/SSL encryption. It supports both one-way and mutual (two-way) SSL authentication.

=== Certificate Configuration

Requires configuration of SSL keystores and truststores:

- Keystore: Contains the client's private key and certificate (for mutual authentication)
- Truststore: Contains trusted certificate authorities and broker certificates
- Password protection for both keystores and private keys

=== SSL Protocol Support

Supports modern TLS protocols (TLSv1.2 by default) with configurable enabled protocols. Older SSL versions are discouraged due to security vulnerabilities.

=== Hostname Verification

Includes endpoint identification algorithm for server hostname verification using server certificates, ensuring protection against man-in-the-middle attacks.

=== Production Security

Designed for production environments requiring strong encryption and certificate-based authentication. Provides comprehensive security for sensitive data transmission.
